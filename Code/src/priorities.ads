-- This package defines the priorities of all three tasks.
-- See subchapter 3.5 for the reponse time analysis.
-- The priorities are defined as follows:
-- Sense : 3
-- Think : 2
-- Act   : 1

-- The priorities where chosen based on what we as a group thought was the most important task.

package Priorities is
   Sense : constant := 3;
   Think : constant := 2;
   Act   : constant := 1;
end Priorities;
